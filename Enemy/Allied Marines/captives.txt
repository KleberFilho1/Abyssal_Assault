CAPTIVE MARINES: Bound Marines that can be killed by enemies & killed by you for 
a couple of Stimpacks (you Monster! I hope you were desperate for that health!) 
or freed if you activate them. They will then arm themselves with one of these:
- Fist
- Pistol
- Machinegun
- Chaingun
- Shotgun
- Chainsaw
- Minigun
- Plasmagun
- Super-Shotgun

The Spawned Marines are exactly the same as their counter-parts, meaning Health 
is reset to 200% & they will follow & help you as normal. I recommend you space 
them out a bit & don't place them too close to walls*. If a captive Marine is 
dead, they won't activate when triggered. They have a higher Radius than 
Allied Marines (Captives are technically Switchable Decorations) that you allow 
to activate them without having to stand right next to them, current Radius is 
32 units (default was 20) but anything up to 56 will be more realistic & help 
with positioning, how easily you want to "Use" the Allies & spacing them out. 
As long as you can step backward or strafe away from the direction they'll spawn, 
you shouldn't lose them as often. Remember the Radius also effects how easily 
bullets or explosive radius & melee attacks can damage the captives... so I 
wouldn't set it higher than 32, or 40 (48 or 56 if you want even easier access).

*Another thing you need to remember is that the Marines will spawn in the 
Direction the Captive Marine Actor is facing when it was placed on the map. 
As a safeguard to Tele-stomping the Player, if you or an enemy stays too close or 
the bound marines are too close to walls or not spaced out far enough, the 
captive Marine will just disappear when freed. This also stops freed Allies from 
clipping inside walls like Lost Souls sometimes will do when a Pain Elemental is 
killed in a confined space. It also stops them from clipping to ceilings.

//ACTIVATION
You need to Tag & give them a "Thing_Activate"** Command then Activate them via 
triggered event*** or the Player can activate them by standing next to them & 
pressing the "Use" Button (as if opening a door or activating a Switch).

**Thing_Activate GZDoom Builder Action 130. I've tried using this when the 
Marines are tagged 0, they won't activate as 0 is the calling actor (usually you), 
I also recommend tagging each marine with a separate number, it might sound a 
bit frustrating to some, but if all the Captives have the same number & one is 
killed or activated by a player or an enemy, every one of the captives with the 
same number will spring to life, equip a weapon & start attacking the enemies 
etc... Useful for surprise attacks, but I seriously don't recommend this for 
wide spread captives in different areas of a Map.

***Triggered Events: such as pressing a switch, walking over a special line or 
any scripted action. This is best saved for scripts & leaving the decision to 
free any captives up to you (the Player).

Example: Tag a Captive 999, give him the "Thing_Activate" & set up another way 
to activate him (collecting a weapon quickest example) with the same 
"Thing_Activate" command, the killed Marine should not activate if his corpse is 
touched & "used" by Player or any other trigger that would save him is started.
//ACTIVATION FLAGS
Triggered events was the original way to save the marines I'd set up. It still 
has some use, so it's worth mentioning. But these are destroyable, Switchable 
Decorations & +UseSpecial Flag was added for the Activation set up now in place.

Activation Flag Descriptions from ZDOOM Wiki:
+USESPECIAL
The actor's special will be triggered when the player presses use while facing 
this actor. The player will be considered the activator of the special.

+BUMPSPECIAL
The actor's special will be triggered when the player touches this actor. 
The player will be considered the activator of the special.
/*I don't recommend +BUMPSPECIAL. You have more chance of losing the captive if 
you accidentally walk into him or are knocked into him & don't or can't move.*/
