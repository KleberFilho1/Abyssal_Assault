Info:
17 Allied Marines with extensive behaviour changes including shooting, reaction 
timing, movement speed & parameters, tracking & targeting as well as a Large 
Arsenal of weapons to assist the Player. Also includes Captive Marines & Colour 
Blend templates to increase diversity as Allies or additional Enemies. 

Combat:
Marines will attack any enemy on sight or continue to search for fresh targets. 
If an enemy is nearby (even if you can't see it yet), they will stay close to 
you trying to find a way to attack it. If no targets are in sight, they will 
start to wander (excluding Chainsaw Marine.)

Remember they aren't unstoppable killing machines, so don't expect to put your 
feet up, while they do all the hard work for you. The Marines only have 200% 
Health & varied pain chances. Friendly Fire isn't taken into consideration*.
you can kill them, they can kill you.

All Marines react quickly after being attacked. And will climb up steps up that
are at a height of 32 or less & drop down from heights of 64 or less. This gives
all the marines more freedom of movement & makes it easier for them to chase
targets, you can push them around as well, but they can't be forced or knocked
off any platform, they have to walk or teleport off that area themselves. All 
Marines apart from the Fist & Chainsaw users try to avoid Melee damage. Allies 
using explosives & snipers will back-pedal to try and escape as targets close in.

*Rapid-firing Marines like Chainginners will stop shooting if you walk in front 
of them but their attacks are based on enemy's distance from them, not your 
distance between the Marine & it's target. Player is not immume to the
Flamethrower's dropped fire, Plasma or Rail damage, Explosives or the 
BFG-9000's Tracers.

Death:
Any Marine can be healed or revived, if an Archvile (or anything similar) does 
so, the Marines will turn against each other & you. If you revive them, they 
will remain allied to you, this is because revived actors side with to those who 
revived them.

They all drop* weapons or ammo when killed (except Melee, Flamethrower & Sniper).
*Machinegun, Minigun, Grenadier, Railgun, BFG10K & Bombardier drop weapons or
ammo that is closest to their associated weapons, but add whatever you want.
Example: if you have a Railgun give it to the Railgun Marine, if you have a
Sniper Rifle, give it to the Sniper Marine to create more realism.

Extra Flags:
Marines have the option of being effected by "NoTimeFreeze", "NoFear",
"TeleStomp" or "LookAllAround". It's up to you whether they use it or not,
just remove "//" before the stat in the decorate.

//Melee/Punch: MarineAllyFist
He's pumped up & PO'ed! Fast moving, but only attacks with fists.
Damage output is similar to Revenant's punch attack. Can also charge & jump very
quickly towards targets. If the walls are low enough he might jump at enemies on
there but then climb up! Making him one of the most useful Marines in entire roster.
//Pistol: MarineAllyPistol
Has 2 sets of firing modes making the most of his wimpy weapon.
-A standard single shot, usually his main offence.
-A Quick burst of 3 shots.
//Machinegun: MarineAllyMG
Standard Infantry. Has 2 firing modes.
-A "controlled" 3 Burst Shot, usually his main offence.
-A Rapid-Fire shot like Chaingunner, which can take targets out quickly but he's
more vulnerable to damage.
//Chaingun: MarineAllyCG
Acts like the Chaingunner Zombies but fires from a lot more earlier after seeing
target, once locked onto an enemy, he won't stop firing the target is dead,
has taken cover or if you get in front of his line of sight.
//Shotgun: MarineAllySG
Fast moving. Attacks at mid to close range.
//Minigun: MarineAllyMinigun
Like the Chaingunner, but will attack from an even longer distance & can take
more damage because of his slower movement. Weapon is very fast & very powerful.
Once locked onto a target he won't stop firing the target is dead,
has taken cover or if you get in front of his line of sight.
//Chainsaw: MarineAllyChainsaw
Another fast Melee Marine, but with a chainsaw that does more damage then yours.
//Plasmagun: MarineAllyPlasma
Fires a continuous burst of plasma like the Machinegun Marine. Once locked onto
a target he won't stop firing the target is dead, has taken cover or if you get
in front of his line of sight.
//Rocket Launcher: MarineAllyRocket
Demolition expert! Fires 1 to 3 Rockets with 2 varied attacks. Will try to avoid 
targets early as they close in.
//BFG-9000: MarineAllyBFG9000
Standard, wander & "fire when ready" behaviour. Oh! And he has the BFG-9000!
Tempted to kill him yourself now, are we? ;) You'd be safer standing behind him, 
as tracers from Ally's BFG will damage, Barrels, Enemies, other Allies & you!
//Super-Shotgun MarineAllySSG
Similar to Shotgun Marine, but a lot more powerful. Very slow firing rate but
they make up for that with their powerful weaponry.
//Railgun: MarineAllyRailgun
Sniper, with a piercing Railgun attack. Will stand & shoot, then keep attacking
with a slow rate of fire until the target has died, run away or if you get in
front of his line of sight. Will also try to avoid targets early as they close in.
//Bombardier: MarineAllyHSMissile
Shoots a fast moving, homing missile. Will attack from a longer distance.
The missile is highly accurate making this Marine a decent Sniper too. Will try 
to avoid targets early as they close in.
//Grenadier: MarineAllyGL
Launches Timed Grenades that do more damage then Rockets or Homing Missiles. Will 
try to avoid targets early as they close in.
//BFG-10K: MarineAllyBFG10K
Stand back & watch the fun! Rapid Firing BFG powered "Hit-scan" shots with an
explosion radius, careful placement is required because he won't be killed
easily. Avoids Melee as much as possible, once locked onto a target he won't
stop firing the target is dead, has taken cover or if you get in front of his
line of sight. Will try to avoid targets early as they close in.
//Flamethrower: MarineAllyFlamethrower
Will attack at mid-range, as if using a melee attack so keep him covered then
let him pave the way for you, just don't stand on the fire! Friendly Fire is not
funny ;) When an enemy is cornered, there's little chance they will survive.
//Sniper: MarineAllySniper:
Another True Sniper based Marine, bullets are fired as fast projectiles dealing
mid to high damage. Will attack from a longer distance & avoid Melee attacks as
much as possible. Will stay stationary & keep attacking like the Railgun Marine,
with a slow rate of fire, until his current target has died, runs away or if
you get in his line of sight. Will try to avoid targets early as they close in.
