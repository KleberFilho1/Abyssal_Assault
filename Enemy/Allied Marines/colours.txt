  //"Team Deathmatch" Marines
  While I don't use multi-player, I know a lot of Doomer's do.
  So after an update from 10/02/16, I've followed up on an idea of allocating
  colours to Marines for different teams as Allies after being suggested by
  yuraofthehairfan. I've created this extra "patch" for you to change any of the 
  Ally's colours to the available defaults in ZDoom/GZDoom & Zandronum...
 
  Or you can also, make them easier to spot enemy Marines just take the 
  "Friendly" attribute away from the Decorate. If you want to make these a Rival 
  Marine set I suggest You a separate file* (Decorate, Sound Info WAD etc).
  Then copy the marine sprites you want to use & add ONE of the colour range
  Translations into the Decorate, place it anywhere before that Marine's 
  "States". You can only change their colours by "Translation".
  
*Create a separate file & copy/paste everything from here if you want a full 
Blue Team, a full Red Team etc & want to use both on the same map. You will have 
to change the Summon codes & names too or one will overwrite the other...

//Blending Tutorial 
Copy & paste any of the "Translations" (Word "Translation" & the numbers) into
a Marine's Decorate, placing it anywhere before the "States" commands.
The Translations given only changes the Green suit that the Marine Ally has.

Example:
 
 actor MarineAllyFist 11811
{
  Game Doom
  //$Category Monsters
  //$Title Ally 01- Punch
  //$Sprite ALLY01
    Health 200
	GibHealth -45
    Radius 20
    Height 56
    Speed 15
    PainChance 64
	Translation "112:127=176:191"
	//Green is now Bright Red
  MONSTER
  
The colour range can only be within Doom's Palette & above is a list 15 new
colours to choose from that (apart from black) aren't mono-toned & don't hide
every detail on the marine's body...

Remember you can make 1 or more Marines Blue, Red etc. on here, that's because,
changing the colour will change the colour of that specific Marine, so this
could help with say, character development or speciality labelling such as
Greens are the standard Marines, Reds are the "Heavy Weapons" & Blues are the
"Plasma weapons".
