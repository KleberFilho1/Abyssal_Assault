1. Texture C2MARB90 is an alternate and enhanced version of texture C2MARB01, credited to Fox666
   and NeuralStunner in addition to Cage for the original.
2. There are two C2MARB90 textures, one in between the TX_ markers, and one outside of the markers.
   The difference between the two is that the one in between the markers is paletted while the one
   outside the of markers is in truecolor. The outside one will not be loaded by default in the
   editor. So if one wants to use it, they either need to switch it with the one in between the
   markers, or move it in and give it a unique name so both are available for use.
